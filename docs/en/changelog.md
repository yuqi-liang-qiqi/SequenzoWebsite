# Changelog

**18 Sep 2025:** Updated most of the documentation in both English and Chinese, and upgraded Sequenzo to version 0.1.17.

**3 Oct 2025:** Enhanced Sequenzo by (1) adding entropy and other complexity measures, (2) incorporating advanced models such as sequence history analysis and sequence analysis multi-stte model, as well as (3) supporting the hierarchical clustering Ward D method from R. 

**4 Oct 2025:** 🎉 Exciting milestone: Sequenzo has just welcomed its first external contributor!

Open collaboration means the project is truly taking shape — huge thanks to [Sebastian Daza](https://sdaza.com/) for debugging key issues and improving README. This marks Sequenzo’s first step toward a broader open-source community.
