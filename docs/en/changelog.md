# What's New

**7 Oct 2025:** 

We have just released a new version of Sequenzo (v0.1.19), which fixes the installation issue that some users experienced with pip install sequenzo in v0.1.18.

This update also corrects the transition matrix calculation and introduces a few new but less frequently used methods, including Sequence History Analysis and the Sequence Analysis Multi-State Model.

**4 Oct 2025:** 🎉 Exciting milestone: Sequenzo has just welcomed its first external contributor!

Open collaboration means the project is truly taking shape — huge thanks to [Sebastian Daza](https://sdaza.com/) for debugging key issues and improving README. This marks Sequenzo’s first step toward a broader open-source community.

**3 Oct 2025:** Upgraded Sequenzo to version 0.1.18. Enhanced Sequenzo by (1) adding entropy and other complexity measures, (2) incorporating advanced models such as sequence history analysis and sequence analysis multi-stte model, as well as (3) supporting the hierarchical clustering Ward D method from R.

**18 Sep 2025:** Updated most of the documentation in both English and Chinese, and upgraded Sequenzo to version 0.1.17.
