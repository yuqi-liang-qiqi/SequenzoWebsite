# What's New

**11 Nov 2025:**

Sequenzo version v0.1.24 has been released.

This update fixed and improved the fastcluster and CLARA clustering methods and their environment dependencies,
making it easier for users to download and use Sequenzo.

This update also further improved the index plot and state distribution plot,
making them more user-friendly.

**7 Oct 2025:** 

We have just released a new version of Sequenzo (v0.1.19), which fixes the installation issue that some users experienced with pip install sequenzo in v0.1.18.

This update also corrects the transition matrix calculation and introduces a few new but less frequently used methods, including Sequence History Analysis and the Sequence Analysis Multi-State Model.

**4 Oct 2025:** 🎉 Exciting milestone: Sequenzo has just welcomed its first external contributor!

Open collaboration means the project is truly taking shape — huge thanks to [Sebastian Daza](https://sdaza.com/) for debugging key issues and improving README. This marks Sequenzo’s first step toward a broader open-source community.

**3 Oct 2025:** Upgraded Sequenzo to version 0.1.18. Enhanced Sequenzo by (1) adding entropy and other complexity measures, (2) incorporating advanced models such as sequence history analysis and sequence analysis multi-stte model, as well as (3) supporting the hierarchical clustering Ward D method from R.
