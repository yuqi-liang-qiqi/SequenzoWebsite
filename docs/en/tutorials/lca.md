Imagine you’re looking at the life courses of 10,000 women from age 18 to 70, recorded each year as being in one of four states: Healthy (H), Mild symptoms (M), Limited mobility (L), or Dependent (D).

You see thousands of unique sequences like:
`HHHHMMMMMLLDD...`, `HHHHHHHHHHHMLL...`, `HHHMMMMMDDD...`, and so on.

At first glance, this looks a bit messey in the data as every person seems different.

LCA tries to explain this sequence differences by assuming **there are only a few hidden life-course types** that generate these observable patterns. These hidden types (or latent classes) could be thought of as invisible “scripts” that people roughly follow, with some randomness.

#### Step 1. Imagine hidden templates

Suppose there are three hidden groups. 

Each class is like a template that gives the probability of being in each health state at each age.

For example, the following probabilities describe the expected state distribution for Class 1 members at each age:

   | Age | P(Healthy) | P(Mild) | P(Limited) | P(Dependent) |
   | --- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
   | 50  | 0.90       | 0.10    | 0.00       | 0.00         |
   | 60  | 0.70       | 0.25    | 0.05       | 0.00         |
   | 70  | 0.40       | 0.40    | 0.15       | 0.05         |

We can see that Class 1 represents people who mostly stay healthy until later life: roughly 9 out of 10 are healthy at age 50, and about 7 out of 10 are still healthy by age 60.

We check the state distribution for each class, and let's say the three latet classes are:

* **Class 1 Healthy Agers:** people who mostly stay healthy through life.
* **Class 2 Gradual Decliners:** start healthy but slowly develop mobility limits.
* **Class 3 Early Frailty:** health problems appear relatively early.

#### Step 2. Model how observed sequences arise

**Each latent class defines a probability distribution** over possible states *at each time point.*
   
Using the same example of Class 1 (Healthy Agers):

   | Age | P(Healthy) | P(Mild) | P(Limited) | P(Dependent) |
   | --- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
   | 50  | 0.90       | 0.10    | 0.00       | 0.00         |
   | 60  | 0.70       | 0.25    | 0.05       | 0.00         |
   | 70  | 0.40       | 0.40    | 0.15       | 0.05         |

These probabilities are like the biases of a weighted die: at age 60, a “Healthy Ager” rolls that die once, and there’s a 70 % chance of landing on *Healthy*, 25 % on *Mild*, etc.

Then, **given a person’s latent class**, the model assumes *local independence*, i.e., the health state at each age is independent of other ages once you know the class.

In practical terms, that means we treat each age as a separate “draw” from the class-specific distribution.

So if someone belongs to Class 1:

   * At age 50, we “draw” one state using the probabilities for age 50;
   * At age 60, another draw using the probabilities for age 60;
   * And so on for each age.

The sequence `H H M L D …` is therefore a *series of outcomes* from these repeated draws.

**Across individuals**, randomness makes sequences differ even within the same class.

One Class 1 person might happen to draw *Healthy* at every age; another might draw *Mild* once or twice.
   But statistically, the *distribution* of states in the class matches those class-level probabilities.

#### Step 3. Estimate what the hidden templates must look like

But how do we know who belongs to which class, or what the class probabilities are?

The model searches for the combination of:

* class proportions (η’s), and
* within-class probabilities (π’s for each health state and age)

that makes the *entire set of observed sequences most likely*.

This step uses **maximum-likelihood estimation**, typically through the EM algorithm.

It’s like having a huge bag of sequences and asking:

> “What mix of invisible recipe-cards (latent classes) could have plausibly baked all these sequences?”

#### Step 4. Assign people to their most likely class

Once the model finds the best-fitting set of classes, we can compute, for each person:

`P(Class 1 | her sequence)`, `P(Class 2 | her sequence)`, `P(Class 3 | her sequence)`

and assign her to the class with the highest posterior probability.

So, a woman who is mostly healthy until age 70 might get 0.90 probability of being “Healthy Ager,” while another whose health drops sharply after 55 might get 0.80 probability of being “Gradual Decliner.”

#### Step 5. Determine how many classes there should be

Just like in clustering, you must choose how many latent classes to use.

Researchers usually estimate several models (e.g., 2–8 classes) and compare their **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** and **entropy** (classification certainty). The model with the lowest BIC and high entropy (close to 1) is preferred.

#### Step 6. Interpret and visualize the classes

Finally, each class is summarized and visualized using sequence plots. For instance, average probabilities of being in each state over time.

Researchers then interpret these classes substantively: “stable health,” “delayed decline,” “early frailty,” etc.

**The underlying idea**

Formally, LCA assumes **local independence**: within a latent class, health states at different ages are statistically independent once you know the class.

That’s a simplification as it ignores temporal correlation. But in practice, it works surprisingly well because differences between classes dominate over within-class dependencies.

You can think of it this way:

Each latent class is a “probability generator” that produces many different sequences with similar tendencies, like different dice that have distinct biases for each health outcome at each age.
