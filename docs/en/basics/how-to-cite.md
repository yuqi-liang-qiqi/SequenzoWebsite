# How to Cite Sequenzo and the Documentation Website

The Sequenzo ecosystem currently consists of two components that, while related, should be cited separately depending on their use.

**1. Sequenzo Python Package**

A high-performance toolkit for social sequence analysis, offering efficient data structures, dissimilarity measures, clustering, visualization utilities, and additional tools designed for large-scale sequence datasets.

**2. Documentation Website**

This website goes beyond a traditional user manual. It contains extensive tutorials, conceptual explanations, and practical examples. 

These materials not only teach users how to work with Sequenzo, but also introduce fundamental concepts, methods, and best practices in social sequence analysis. The aim is to support learners and researchers at all levels.

Because these two components differ in content, purpose, and publication format, please choose the citation that corresponds to what you are using.

## Citation Guidelines

**If you use the Sequenzo Python package in your research**

Please cite the Sequenzo package paper (coming soon).

**If you reference or quote content from the documentation website, including tutorials, conceptual discussions, or methodological notes**

Please cite the documentation website’s Zenodo record:

> Liang, Y., Li, X., & Meyerhoff-Liang, J. H. E. (2025).
> *Documentation Website for Sequenzo and Social Sequence Analysis.* Zenodo.
> [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17698151](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17698151)

Thank you 🌟
