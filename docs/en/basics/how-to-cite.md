# How to Cite Sequenzo and the Documentation Website

The Sequenzo ecosystem consists of two closely related but fundamentally different components:

**1. Sequenzo Package**

The Sequenzo Python package is a high-performance toolkit for scalable and accessible social sequence analysis.

It provides efficient data structures, dissimilarity measures, clustering utilities, visualization tools, and computational enhancements tailored to modern large-scale sequence datasets.

**2. Documentation Website**

The documentation website is more than a manual for the package.

It includes a wide range of tutorials, conceptual explanations, and practical walkthroughs.
These materials not only demonstrate how to use Sequenzo, but also introduce key ideas, methods, and workflows in social sequence analysis as a whole.

Our goal is to support learners and researchers, from beginners to advanced users, in understanding both the theory and applied practice of sequence analysis.
