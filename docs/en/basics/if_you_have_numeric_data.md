# Converting Numeric Data to Categorical Data

In sequence analysis, we usually work with **categorical states** (e.g., "Education", "Employment", "Unemployed").
But many datasets contain **numeric values** (e.g., income, CO‚ÇÇ emissions, examnination scores).

To use such data in sequence analysis, we need to convert numeric values into categories (states).

## Why Do We Need Categories?

* Sequence analysis is about comparing **paths of states**.
* Numeric values can be too fine-grained (e.g., CO‚ÇÇ emissions = 0.71 vs 0.72) and make no sense to treat as separate ‚Äústates.‚Äù
* Categories make it possible to study categorical patterns, trajectories, and transitions instead of focusing on tiny numeric differences.

## What Can We Study Once Numeric Data Is Categorized?

By converting them into categorical states, we can treat them as categorical trajectories and ask the following sequence-based questions:

### 1. Income Trajectories

* **Numeric variable**: annual income (in USD).
* **Categorical conversion**: income deciles (bottom 10%, 10‚Äì20%, ‚Ä¶ top 10%).
* **Research questions**:

  * How do individuals move across income brackets over their careers?
  * Are there ‚Äústicky floors‚Äù (people remaining in the bottom deciles) or ‚Äúglass ceilings‚Äù (barriers to reaching top deciles)?
  * How do income trajectories differ by gender, education, or region?

### 2. CO‚ÇÇ Emissions per Capita

* **Numeric variable**: annual CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita (metric tons).
* **Categorical conversion**: global deciles (very low ‚Üí very high).
* **Research questions**:

  * How do countries move between emission categories over time?
  * Which regions show convergence (becoming similar) vs divergence (becoming more unequal) in their emission trajectories?
  * Are there typical ‚Äúpaths‚Äù countries follow (e.g., from low ‚Üí middle ‚Üí high emissions as they industrialize)?

### 3. Examination Scores (e.g., students across school years)

* **Numeric variable**: standardized test scores (0‚Äì100).
* **Categorical conversion**: performance groups (Low, Average, High).
* **Research questions**:

  * What are the typical learning trajectories students follow? (e.g., consistently high, late improvement, early decline)
  * Do certain groups of students converge toward similar performance categories over time?
  * How do interventions (e.g., tutoring programs) change the sequence of performance states?

## Common Methods for Conversion

1. **Fixed Thresholds (Domain Knowledge)**

   * You set cutoffs based on meaningful criteria.
   * Example: Body Mass Index (BMI) ‚Üí Underweight (<18.5), Normal (18.5‚Äì24.9), Overweight (25‚Äì29.9), Obese (30+).
   * Advantage: Easy to interpret.
   * Limitation: Requires expert knowledge; may not reflect the data distribution.

2. **Quantiles (Data-Driven Binning)**

   * Split data into equal-sized groups using percentiles, quartiles, quintiles, or deciles.
   * Example: Income ‚Üí Bottom 20% = ‚ÄúLow‚Äù, 20‚Äì40% = ‚ÄúLower-Middle‚Äù, ‚Ä¶, Top 20% = ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù.
   * Advantage: Balanced group sizes; good for comparisons.
   * Limitation: Categories are relative to the dataset, not absolute values.

3. **Standard Deviation from Mean (Z-Scores)**

   * Define categories based on how far a value is from the mean.
   * Example: Test Scores ‚Üí Below ‚àí1œÉ = ‚ÄúLow Performer‚Äù, ‚àí1œÉ to +1œÉ = ‚ÄúAverage‚Äù, Above +1œÉ = ‚ÄúHigh Performer‚Äù.
   * Advantage: Good when data is approximately normal.
   * Limitation: Harder for non-technical audiences to interpret.

## Step-by-Step Example: CO‚ÇÇ Emissions

Suppose we have **per capita CO‚ÇÇ emissions** (in metric tons):

| Country | Year | CO‚ÇÇ per capita |
| ------- | ---- | -------------- |
| A       | 2000 | 0.8            |
| B       | 2000 | 2.5            |
| C       | 2000 | 7.2            |
| D       | 2000 | 15.0           |

### Using Quantiles (Deciles)

1. Collect all values: \[0.8, 2.5, 7.2, 15.0].
2. Compute decile cutoffs (10 equally sized bins). For simplicity:

   * 0‚Äì10% = 0.8
   * 10‚Äì20% = 1.5
   * 20‚Äì30% = 2.5
   * ‚Ä¶
   * 90‚Äì100% = 15.0
3. Assign states:

   * Country A = 1st decile (very low)
   * Country B = 3rd decile (low-middle)
   * Country C = 7th decile (high)
   * Country D = 10th decile (very high)

Now we can represent each country‚Äôs emission history as a **sequence of categorical states** instead of raw numbers.

* With categories, we can say:

  * Country A stayed in ‚Äúvery low‚Äù for 20 years.
  * Country C moved from ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù to ‚Äúhigh‚Äù after 1990.
* Without categories, comparing 0.71 vs 0.72 would not give meaningful patterns.

If you would like to learn further how it is computed in Python, we have a complete guide with code in [`CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Dataset (1800‚Äì2022) üåç`](/en/datasets/CO2-emissions). 

## Key Takeaways

* Sequence analysis requires categorical states ‚Üí numeric values must be grouped.
* You can choose thresholds (expert-defined), quantiles (data-driven), or statistical cutoffs.
* Deciles are often a good balance: enough granularity to see differences, but not too many categories to overwhelm the analysis.

## Exercises: Converting Numeric Data to Categorical Data

### Exercise 1: Why Categories?
Suppose you measure daily step counts from wearable devices (e.g., 9,950 vs 10,020).  
Why might it be unhelpful to treat each exact number as a separate state in sequence analysis?  

### Exercise 2: Household Electricity Use
Four households report their **monthly electricity consumption (kWh)**:

| Household | Consumption |
|-----------|-------------|
| A         | 120         |
| B         | 220         |
| C         | 350         |
| D         | 800         |

1. Convert these values into **quartiles** (4 equal-sized groups).  
2. Assign each household to a quartile category (`Q1 = Very Low`, `Q2 = Low-Medium`, `Q3 = Medium-High`, `Q4 = Very High`).  

### Exercise 3: Blood Pressure Categories
A health survey records systolic blood pressure: 110, 125, 138, 162.  
Use the standard clinical thresholds:

- Normal: <120  
- Elevated: 120‚Äì129  
- Hypertension Stage 1: 130‚Äì139  
- Hypertension Stage 2: ‚â•140  

Assign each person to a category.  

### Exercise 4: Student Attendance (Z-Scores)
Absences from school (days per year) are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12.  
The mean = 6.4, standard deviation = 3.4.  
Define categories:  

- Below ‚àí1œÉ ‚Üí "Very Low Absence"  
- ‚àí1œÉ to +1œÉ ‚Üí "Typical Absence"  
- Above +1œÉ ‚Üí "High Absence"  

Classify each student.  

### Exercise 5: Water Pollution Levels
Average river nitrate concentration (mg/L) is reported for two regions:

| Region | 2000 | 2010 | 2020 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| A      | 0.5  | 1.2  | 2.8  |
| B      | 6.0  | 6.5  | 7.5  |

1. Define three categories using **equal-width binning**:  
   - Low: 0‚Äì2  
   - Medium: 2‚Äì5  
   - High: >5  
2. Represent each region‚Äôs trajectory as a sequence of categorical states.  

## Answers and Explanations

### Exercise 1
Tiny numeric differences (e.g., 9,950 vs 10,020 steps) don‚Äôt indicate meaningful differences in behavior.  
Sequence analysis is about **paths of discrete states** (e.g., ‚ÄúSedentary,‚Äù ‚ÄúModerately Active,‚Äù ‚ÄúHighly Active‚Äù). Categorization allows us to focus on interpretable patterns.  

### Exercise 2
Sorted consumption: [120, 220, 350, 800].  
Quartile assignment:  
- Q1 = 120 ‚Üí Very Low  
- Q2 = 220 ‚Üí Low-Medium  
- Q3 = 350 ‚Üí Medium-High  
- Q4 = 800 ‚Üí Very High  

### Exercise 3
- 110 ‚Üí Normal (<120)  
- 125 ‚Üí Elevated (120‚Äì129)  
- 138 ‚Üí Hypertension Stage 1 (130‚Äì139)  
- 162 ‚Üí Hypertension Stage 2 (‚â•140)  

### Exercise 4
Z-scores = (value ‚àí mean)/œÉ:  
- 2 ‚Üí (2‚àí6.4)/3.4 ‚âà ‚àí1.29 ‚Üí Very Low Absence  
- 4 ‚Üí ‚àí0.70 ‚Üí Typical Absence  
- 6 ‚Üí ‚àí0.12 ‚Üí Typical Absence  
- 8 ‚Üí 0.47 ‚Üí Typical Absence  
- 12 ‚Üí 1.65 ‚Üí High Absence  

### Exercise 5
Using bins: Low (0‚Äì2), Medium (2‚Äì5), High (>5).  

- Region A: 0.5 (Low) ‚Üí 1.2 (Low) ‚Üí 2.8 (Medium) ‚Üí Sequence = [Low, Low, Medium]  
- Region B: 6.0 (High) ‚Üí 6.5 (High) ‚Üí 7.5 (High) ‚Üí Sequence = [High, High, High]  

Interpretation:  
- Region A shows a shift from Low to Medium pollution.  
- Region B remains consistently High.
